# seq2seqhuntoeng

I have made a Machine Translation model with Recurrence-based Seq2Seq architecture to translate Hungarian texts to English texts. 
The dataset I've used comes from Tatoeba, a collection of sentence translations in a variety of languages sourced from volunteers: https://tatoeba.org/en
